        <h2>A Life Well Lived</h2>
        <div id="tribute-info">
          <p>
            During the less than 13 years of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s
            leadership of the modern American Civil Rights Movement, from
            December 1955 until April 4, 1968, African Americans achieved more
            genuine progress toward racial equality in America than the previous
            350 years had produced. Dr. King is widely regarded as America’s
            pre-eminent advocate of nonviolence and one of the greatest
            nonviolent leaders in world history.
          </p>

          <p>
            Drawing inspiration from both his Christian faith and the peaceful
            teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. King led a nonviolent movement in
            the late 1950s and ‘60s to achieve legal equality for
            African-Americans in the United States. While others were advocating
            for freedom by “any means necessary,” including violence, Martin
            Luther King, Jr. used the power of words and acts of nonviolent
            resistance, such as protests, grassroots organizing, and civil
            disobedience to achieve seemingly-impossible goals. He went on to
            lead similar campaigns against poverty and international conflict,
            always maintaining fidelity to his principles that men and women
            everywhere, regardless of color or creed, are equal members of the
            human family.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, Nobel Peace Prize lecture and
            “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” are among the most revered orations
            and writings in the English language. His accomplishments are now
            taught to American children of all races, and his teachings are
            studied by scholars and students worldwide. He is the only
            non-president to have a national holiday dedicated in his honor and
            is the only non-president memorialized on the Great Mall in the
            nation’s capital. He is memorialized in hundreds of statues, parks,
            streets, squares, churches and other public facilities around the
            world as a leader whose teachings are increasingly-relevant to the
            progress of humankind.
