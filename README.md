A tribute page to Martin Luther King Jr. I wanted to do something different from the FCC template.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
Remembering how to make an image responsive while keeping its aspect ratio. That was the biggest challenge. Tweaking the container and image height and width. It has something to do with setting width to auto or 100%. I never remember which does what lol.

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
I'm super proud of myself for this one. By far the fastest I've ever completed a project. The key is in knowing the general parameters. Outlining the HTML first and completing the easier stuff I know for sure how to do. The CSS is my favorite part. Tweaking the styles to get everything to look professional and how I see it in my mind. It's like creating digital art. =D
